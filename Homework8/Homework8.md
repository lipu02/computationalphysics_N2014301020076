##Abstract
Chaos is a complex phenomenon and it has many interesting properties.This article will investigate some interesting properties of chaotic phenomena by research of physical pendulum.

##Program
Utilize Euler-Cromer method to solve it, and plot its phase diagram to prove that the system can be chaotic.

Its phase diagram

Fix other parameters unchanged,change F,and fetch theta value of 400th period of driven force under every different F,then plot bifurcation diagram.

##Results
When F varies from 0 to 10,We can acquire the following bifurcation diagram:

Magnifying its horizontal axis scale again we can find that the bifurcation digram has many fractal structures.
