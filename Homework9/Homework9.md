##Abstract
The billiard system can also be a chaotic system. In this problem, I will try to solve the trajectories of different kinds of tables and show the phase diagram to see whether the system is chaotic or not.

##Influence of diverse boundaries
This is the trajectory of the billiard ball in the case of square boundary. Actually if the ratio of  and  is rational, the square cannot be fully filled, for the quantity of irrational number is larger.

 This is the trajectory of the billiard ball in the case of circular boundary. It shows that the billiard ball cannot reach the center part, which is determined by the position of tha ball and direction of initial. velocity.

  This is Poincare section by scattering the points only when the billiard ball crosses the y = 0 axis.
